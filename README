Description of the problem:

- the whole homework was made as a treasure hunt where you were sending http requests to the server and the server send back responses which helped you
format the next http request to the server and so on, untill you solved the treasure hunt.
- each task had different, or added up, more parameters which you needed to handle from the json response that was given to you.

The steps to resolve each task were:
	- handle and extract the parameters given to you via the json response;
	- extract the cookies with the CookieGetter function ( was not needed for the first task) : CookieGetter function searched for the string "Set cookie" then extracted 
	everything from the first space to the end of the message which represented the cookies(they were also given in the json file);
	- set the connection and make the GET/POST request, with the parameters;
	- send the request and get the response from the server;
	- close the connection;
